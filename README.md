# Risk of Rain 2 Run Generator
This is a run generator for RoR2. It can generate you the character to play, a route to take, and artifacts to select. It reads from your savefile in order to generate relevant runs.

It is customizable through settings.json
## How to use
- Download and install [.NET Runtime for .NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0).

- Download the generator files from [Releases](https://github.com/inkyarev/ror2-run-generator/releases).

- Run the executable.
## Plans for the future
- Currently you're left in the blind when the generator says "Unlock Artifact of X". Gonna add some ways for the user to know what to do. Could be either a plain code insertion or a hint on which stage the code tablets appear.
- Maybe gonna add some challenges. Maybe.
- Making UI for this.
